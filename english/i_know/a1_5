When the adjective ends with an'-e' , we only add '-r' ath the end the adjective.

When the adjective ends with "-y" , we drop the "-y" and replace it with "ier" at the
end of the adjective

When tha adjective ends with "consonant + vowel + consonant", we double the last
consonant and add '-er' at the end.
