Simple present vs. Present Continuous
- We use the simple present tense for habits, daily routines, permanent states , and
  general truths or laws of nature.

  He keeps arriving late

 - We use present continuous tense for actions that are in progress in the present

 Jamie is staying with me nowadays
 He is on his way to the gym right now
 Are you still working at that place

Stative Verbs
We do not normally use some verbs in continuous tenses. These are generally verbs that do
not show action. They express feelings, ideas, emotions, senses and etc

 I want some coffee right now
 I am wanting some coffee right now(incorrect)
 She knows him
 I see a dog down the street

Have
We do not use the verb "have" in continuous tenses with it shows possession. We can say
"I have a brother", but we cannot say "I'm having a brother" We can only use the continuous
"having" When is is describing an action or process

"Can" for Ability
"Can" is a modal verb. It expresses ability or to say that something is possible or plausible
It is the same for all subjects -- meaning that the word "can" never changes its from under any
circumstances

It is unlikely, but it can happen


on the contrary, the negative form of "can" , "can't" is used to show inability os
something that is not possible

There are three different formulas to form positive, negative, and question "can"
sentences

a good idea

We can use the imperative mood to give orders, instructions, or advice.We can form an
imperative with the simple form of a verb
